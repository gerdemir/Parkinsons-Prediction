# Parkinsons-Prediction
Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a person has pakinson's disease. This dataset contains biomedical voice measurements from people with and without Parkinson’s disease. The goal is to discriminate healthy individuals from those with Parkinson’s disease. The model is trained using supervised machine learning algorithms. The same model was deployed with Streamlit for an interactive web application, the Multi-Disease Prediction Project.

Features

Machine learning model(SVC) trained on a Parkinson's disease dataset. To save the trained model, "pickle" was used.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Parkinson's Disease dataset. www.kaggle.com/datasets/thecansin/parkinsons-data-set

Acknowledgment
This project was inspired by the YouTube tutorial [Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning in Python | Streamlit Web App - Deployment](https://youtu.be/8Q_QQVQ1HZA?si=o4buaDAL0iHhfs_e). I learned from the tutorial and adapted the code with modifications.
